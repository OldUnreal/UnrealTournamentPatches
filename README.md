# OldUnreal Patch Repository for Unreal Tournament (99)

This is the public repository for [OldUnreal's](https://www.oldunreal.com/index.html) Unreal Tournament 99 patches. OldUnreal took over maintenance of the Unreal Tournament code base after reaching an agreement with [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com) in 2019.

Our patches fix hundreds of stability, security and performance problems in the game client, the server, and in Unreal Editor. They also add support for modern platforms and operating systems (such as macOS Catalina), and add new 3d renderers, audio drivers and minor features (such as raw input and high-resolution font/GUI scaling) to better leverage the capabilities of modern gaming systems.

Patch releases hosted here are considered stable enough for widespread use, but they are by no means a finished product. We still release updates on a regular basis.

**Legal Disclaimer:** This project was approved by Epic Games, but it is not an official Epic project, nor has it been reviewed or tested by Epic.

## Installation

This repository contains development snapshots as well as official releases.

### Development Snapshots

If you are a modder or beta tester and you would like to test our latest changes, then simply use git to check out this repository. Note, however, that our development snapshots are generally not suitable for online play, as they might not be recognized by various anti-cheat solutions. Development snapshots may also be less stable than the official releases.

### Official Releases

Our official patch releases can be found on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches/releases). If you are a regular player or if you want to play online, then please use official releases only.

If you want to test out our patches, but maintain the possibility to uninstall them, we strongly urge you to create a backup of your entire UT folder before installing the patch.

#### Windows Installation

We distribute our **Windows** patches in multiple formats. The zip packages can be installed by unpacking them **on top of an existing installation** of Unreal Tournament. No other actions are needed to install the patch.

We also have an exe installer with a wizard. This wizard should automatically find your existing installation.

#### Linux Installation

The **Linux** version of our patch is only available as a tarball. To install, unpack the tarball **on top of an existing installation** of Unreal Tournament. No other actions are needed to install the patch.

#### macOS Installation

The macOS version of our patch comes as an application bundle. You should drag this bundle into your applications library. If you're installing our macOS patch for the first time, you will also need to copy the data files from an existing UT installation into your Application Support Library. To install the data files, you need to do the following:
1. Open a new Finder window
2. Press ⇧⌘G to bring up the "Go to folder:" dialog
3. Enter "~/Library/Application Support/" (without the quotes!) in the edit box and click ok
4. Within the ~/Library/Application Support/ folder, create a new folder called "Unreal Tournament" (without the quotes!)
5. Copy the Maps, Sounds, Textures, and Music folders from your existing UT installation into the folder you've just created
6. Go into the Textures folder and delete the LadderFonts.utx and UWindowFonts.utx files

After installing the data files, you should be able to launch the UnrealTournament app!

## System Requirements

Windows and Linux systems will need a CPU with **SSE2** instruction set support. In practice, this means all 64-bit x86 CPUs, all Intel CPUs since (and including) the Pentium 4, and all AMD CPUs since (and including) the Athlon 64 are supported.

Windows systems will need to run Windows XP or later. Some features (e.g., Cluster and ALAudio) are only available on systems running Windows Vista or later.

Linux systems will need GNU libc 2.19 or later. 

macOS systems will need a 64-bit x86 CPU and Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9) or later. Some rendering features may be unavaiable on macOS.

## Features

Besides fixing hundreds of bugs, the OldUnreal UT patches also add features such as:
* Raw input support and full mouse smoothing control
* OldUnreal's latest OpenGL 4-based 3d renderer (XOpenGLDrv)
* OldUnreal's latest OpenAL-based audio driver (ALAudio)
* Han's latest FMOD-based audio driver (Cluster)
* SDL2-based window management for the Linux and macOS clients
* The latest Demo Manager
* Unreal 227's Unreal Editor 2.2 (with some UT-specific enhancements)
* PNG support for screenshots
* Scaling control for in-game fonts and the game menu
* UTF-8 support for game ini, int, and log files
* Faster server downloads (even without redirect servers)
* Mouse wheel scrolling support for the game menu
* High-DPI awareness for the game and Unreal Editor
* Updated versions of Chris Dohnal's UTGLR OpenGLDrv and D3D9Drv renderers

A full list of patch features and changes is available in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md). 

## Compatibility

While the OldUnreal patches preserve compatibility with the original game as well as most mods made for the original game, there are a couple of compatibility issues people should be aware of.

### For Players

All UnrealScript mods for UT v451b or lower will continue to work in OldUnreal's v469 or later. The following native (C++) mods for older UT versions will not work in v469:

* XC_Engine v24 or below: v469-compatible versions of XC_Engine are available [here](https://ut99.org/viewforum.php?f=63)
* Demo Manager 3.4 or below: Our patches include an updated Demo Manager so there is no need to downgrade to an older version
* D3D8Drv: D3D8Drv will crash in v469. We are not planning to fix this
* D3D10Drv: D3D10Drv has some rendering glitches and does not work in Unreal Editor 2.2
* D3D11Drv: D3D11Drv currently works well in game, but crashes in Unreal Editor 2.2

### For Server Admins

Most UnrealScript mods for UT v451b or lower will continue to work on OldUnreal's v469 or later servers. Some old anti-cheat mods such as CSHP4 and AnthChecker will reject v469 clients, however.

The following native (C++) server mods will not work in v469:
* ServerCrashFix: there is no need to install this mods as all of its fixes have been integrated into the OldUnreal patches
* ACE v1.1f or below: will continue to work on Windows servers but not on Linux servers. Server admins who wish to run ACE on their Linux servers must upgrade to ACE v1.2 or later
* XC_Engine v24 or below: Most of the bug fixes in XC_Engine have been integrated into the OldUnreal patches. Server admins who rely on XC_Engine for its advanced features must upgrade to XC_Engine v25 or later. You can download the latest XC_Engine [here](https://ut99.org/viewforum.php?f=63)

### For Developers

OldUnreal's patches add some new UnrealScript features which should not be used in mods that target compatibility with UT v451b or below. We are working on a document that lists the new features and that describes best practices for developers.

Native mod developers may want to use our updated UT SDK, which will be hosted in this repository.

## Malware Warnings

Our Windows and macOS binaries are digitally signed, but malware/virus scanners may occasionally still flag them as potential malware because our signing certificate is still building up reputation. Additional information can be found [here](https://www.digicert.com/blog/ms-smartscreen-application-reputation/). 

## Donations

We are all volunteers who work on Unreal and Unreal Tournament in our spare time. If you like our work, then please consider making a small donation [here](https://www.oldunreal.com/phpBB3/donate). Please make sure to mention Unreal Tournament in your donation note!

## Other Contributions

We are more than happy to accept other contributions too. Some of the things we could use help with are:

* Installers: The Linux and Mac versions of the patch currently lack an installer script/program. We would gladly accept 3rd party installers contributed by community members.
* Documentation: Likewise, the Linux and Mac patches have little to no documentation. We assume that the installation process is self-explanatory. If you disagree, then please help us write some documentation.
* Missing localizations: the new patches include several new in-game menu options as well as new 3D renderers and audio drivers. The text displayed by these new components is currently available in English only (although Spanish translations will be added soon). If you want to contribute text localizations, then please post them in our issue tracker.
* Hardware: If you have any decent hardware that you want to donate, then please send a direct message to Smirftsch or anth through the OldUnreal forum. We are especially looking for more macOS development systems (we currently only have one 2012 MacBook Pro for 5 developers).

## Bug Reports

You can use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches/issues) to file bug reports. Reasonable feature requests for Unreal Editor can also be posted there. Please do not ask for new features in the game itself as these are out of the scope of our project.

Before filing a bug report, please use the GitHub search function to see if someone else has already reported the same issue. If you find an issue that looks similar to yours, then please submit a comment in the existing issue report.

When filing a bug report, please include relevant details about your setup (i.e., your operating system and version, your UT version and build date, mods you are using) and describe how we can reproduce the problem.
