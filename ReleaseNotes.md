## Unreal Tournament Version 469c Release Notes (Coming Soon!)

Version 469c is completely network compatible with all previous public releases of UT (down to 432).
The UTPG and OldUnreal teams worked hard to maintain binary compatibility with older native mods.
Most of these mods will continue to work in version 469c. However, some mods may need some trivial updates.
If you are a native mod author, and you are having trouble updating your mod for version 469c, then please reach out to us at [the OldUnreal forums](https://www.oldunreal.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=37).
**Note:** This patch disables older versions of ACE.
Server admins should upgrade ACE to version 1.1e or later to check 469c clients.

This patch no longer includes libcurl. Server admins that use the MD5 anti-cheat protection feature and that have automatic updates enabled for the package list will have to manually download libcurl or use the version that came with the previous patch. This change should substantially reduce the number of false positive malware warnings triggered by our patch.

## Unreal Tournament Version 469a Release Notes

Version 469a is completely network compatible with all previous public releases of UT (down to 432).
The UTPG and OldUnreal teams worked hard to maintain binary compatibility with older native mods.
Most of these mods will continue to work in version 469a. However, some mods may need some trivial updates.
If you are a native mod author, and you are having trouble updating your mod for version 469, then please reach out to us at [the OldUnreal forums](https://www.oldunreal.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=37).
**Note:** This patch disables older versions of ACE.
Server admins should upgrade ACE to version 1.1e or later to check 469a clients.

* Fixed an issue where the game would not update stale actor lighting data in the engine cache. As a result, many actors would be renderered in pitch black even when they should be lit. This issue especially affected people playing with large cache sizes or high frame rates.
* Fixed a bug that caused CTF Flags to become dark after being returned to their flag base.
* Fixed an issue where certain sounds would play at double the intended volume while recording a demo.
* Fixed an issue where screenshots would not get rendered correctly if you had your vertical screen resolution set to an odd number of pixels.
* Fixed a bug that caused all decorations in skyboxes to be invisible.
* Fixed a bug that caused the game to stop rendering after changing your FOV in a game type that had its MinFOV and MaxFOV settings set to 0.

#### Miscellaneous

* Fixed an issue where the game would hang for a long time (and sometimes even crash) when opening a maplist with lots of maps.	
* Restored the ability to kick players and bots from local games.
* Fixed an issue where bots considered human players invisible even after their invisibility pickup had expired.
* Fixed several bugs that could cause weapons to instantly switch between fire and alt fire animations.
* Fixed a bug that allowed players to interact with the level and pick up items before the match started after giving up admin privileges via AdminLogout command.
* Team games now properly end when one of the teams scores in overtime.
* The 1024 character limit on conversions between ANSI and Unicode strings is gone.
* Fixed an engine bug that could cause Demo Manager to freeze the game after using the seekto command.
* Eliminated many "Accessed None" warnings.
* Pawns that get destroyed while they have the Destroyed probe function disabled should now get unlinked from the Level Pawnlist.

### Enhancements

#### Unreal Editor

* Merged most of Unreal 227's Unreal Editor enhancements.
* UnrealEd's viewport window allows you to select any of your renderdevices now (not just SoftDrv and D3DDrv).
* UnrealEd's button bar and texture browser now have mouse wheel support.
* UnrealEd's 2D Shape Editor now properly calculates the vertex positions while dragging at zoom levels other than 100 pct.
* UnrealEd now supports mouse wheel scrolling in the 2D viewports.
* UnrealEd now has an "Add PlayerStart" item in the surface popup menu. This item only shows if your level does not have a PlayerStart yet.
* UnrealEd viewports can now render up to 200 frames per second. This framerate was previously capped at 30.
* UnrealEd's vertex editor now properly accumulates small vertex adjustments. Previously, small adjustments could get discarded due to grid snapping.
* Added texture format conversion support to the texture browser.
* Added an option to remove the compressed mips from a texture in the texture browser.
* All UnrealEd viewports now support renderdevice switching.
* Added texture import support for various new image formats.
* The ucc make commandlet now works on Linux and Mac.
* The ucc compress commandlet can now skip compression if an up-to-date .uz file already exists. To use this new feature, add the "update" command line parameter to your ucc compress invocation.
* S3TC/DXT1 texture compression should now be available in the ucc tools for Linux and Mac (though obviously not in UnrealEd).

#### High-resolution Support

* UnrealEd, Setup, and the game client are now high-DPI aware on Windows. This eliminates the bluriness a lot of people with big monitors were seeing. It also improves input precision in the game and the editor.
* Added automatic scaling of the game menu. The scaling factor and behavior can be controlled using the new settings in the menu.
* Added crosshair scaling to the standard HUD. You can configure the crosshair scaling settings in the menu. NOTE: A lot of mods will likely ignore the crosshair scaling. Mod authors should update their mods so they call the regular ChallengeHUD.DrawCrosshair function.
* Added in-game font scaling. When enabled, fonts scale automatically with your desktop DPI. Scaling can be turned on and off in the in-game menu.
* UWindow now supports higher resolution textures for LookAndFeels. This enables LookAndFeels to scale better for people playing at higher resolutions and higher GUI scales. The UMenu LookAndFeels have been (partially) updated to use this new feature.

#### Input and Windowing

* Fixed mouse acceleration issues for players using DirectInput on Windows 10.
* Added raw mouse input support. This feature can be enabled by setting the UseRawHIDInput to true in the WinDrv.WindowsClient section of the game ini.
* Added enhanced pointer precision control. By default, the game enables enhanced pointer precision while in the menu and restores the old precision settings when in game. However, you can now set the NoEnhancedPointerPrecision option in the WinDrv.WindowsClient section to true if you do not want the game to change the system pointer precision settings at all.
* Added new menu options to control the mouse input and smoothing behavior.
* Improved support for mouse side buttons.
* Added mouse wheel scrolling support to the in-game windowing system.
* Added clipboard paste support to the quick console.
* The Linux and Mac clients now have clipboard support.

#### UnrealScript

* Console commands that are over 1024 bytes in length, or that return over 1024 bytes of data should now be safe to use.
* Added a new primitive type called "pointer". Pointer variables automatically adjust to the word width on the target platform. Native mod authors should use pointer variables to mirror a pointer type in C++.
* Added new Canvas functions to create arbitrarily-sized fonts on the fly. Please do not use these functions directly as they will cause your mod to be incompatible with earlier versions of UT. Instead, use the BotPack.FontInfo class to retrieve fonts that are appropriate for the client's screen size.
* Added the "TEXTURE MERGECOMPRESSED NAME=MergeWith FILE=HiResFile.PNG GROUP= " exec command. This command allows you to import and compress hi-res textures and merge them into an existing texture's compressed mipmaps.
* Added HandlePauseRequest to the mutator system, allows modders to modify the behaviour of players' pause button in servers.

#### Security

* Fixed several arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.
* The Windows version of the game now has several security enhancements including (but not limited to) Data Execution Prevention (can be disabled with the -nodep command line parameter), SafeSEH, and ASLR support.

#### Anti-Cheat

* Revamped the UT v468 MD5 code. Older clients can connect to v469a servers now even if they don't support the MD5 extension. The server now also marks which files it wants MD5 checks for.
* MD5 checking is now disabled by default. To enable, set MD5Enable to True under [Engine.GameEngine] in the server's ini file.
* Added an auto-updater for the Packages.md5 list. The auto-updater will check for list updates once an hour if you have MD5Enable and MD5AutoUpdate both set to true under [Engine.GameEngine].

#### Networking and Netcode

* Restored demo compatibility with UT v436.
* Added workarounds for bugs that could cause player animations to break in demos or online play after installing high-resolution S3TC textures.
* Made improvements to the networking code to eliminate the infamous texture skating problem (in nearly all cases).
* The game no longer disables Download Managers if they encounter a non-critical error while attempting to download a file from the server. Previously, the game would stop attempting to download from redirect servers after encountering an HTTP error (such as HTTP 404).
* The game now shows the number of remaining packages while downloading from a server.
* Clients are far less likely to encounter package mismatch errors when connecting to servers, now a UT client can have multiple packages with the same name and the loader will select the right one (if present).
* Added bandwidth control for file downloads from the gameserver. The bandwidth control option overrides the MaxClientRate. It can be controlled in the server.ini file as follows:
```
[IpDrv.TcpNetDriver]
MaxFileDownloadRate=0   Maximum download speed in bytes per second

; Possible values for MaxFileDownloadRate:
; -1                    Send files at the maximum speed possible
;  0                    Limit the file download speed to MaxClientRate bytes per second. This is what UT did by default in versions 468 and below
;  any positive number  Allow download speeds of up to this amount of bytes per second.
```

#### Audio and 3D Rendering

* Screenshots now get stored in the "System/Screenshots" folder. UT will automatically create this folder if it does not already exist. We also removed the limit on the number of screenshots you can have in this folder and we now save screenshots in PNG format rather than BMP.
* Decals are now visible in fog zones.
* Integrated Cluster, a new FMOD-based audio driver with superior sound quality and hyper-realistic sound effects (Thanks han!).
* Integrated enhanced versions of Chris Dohnal's UTGLR OpenGLDrv and D3D9Drv. 
* Integrated OldUnreal's latest XOpenGLDrv. 
* Galaxy Audio is now considered deprecated. On Windows Vista and later, the game launcher will do an automatic one-time upgrade your audio subsystem to the latest version of the OldUnreal Cluster driver.
* Revamped the underlying audio code for sounds played using TournamentPlayer.ClientPlaySound. The revamped code should make playback volumes more consistent and should eliminate audio glitches such as crackling and screeching.

#### Localization

* New language: German (requires testing)
* Italian has been fully updated (requires testing)
* Minor changes to Spanish

#### Miscellaneous

* UnrealEd and the game client are now large address aware on Windows. This means it is far less likely that you'll run out of virtual memory.
* Removed some outdated items from the in-game menu (e.g., ngWorldStats, mplayer, heat, won, ...)
* Rewrote some of the core timing routines so the game runs more smoothly (and with less glitching) on multicore CPUs and in long-running games.
* The Linux and Mac clients finally support unicode! The most visible consequence is that player names with non-ascii characters in them will now display correctly when playing on Linux servers (provided that you use font textures with the proper unicode glyphs).
* The game now uses UTF-8 as the prefered file encoding (unless a UTF-16LE BOM is found at the start of the file).
* Added selectedcursor support to the Linux and Mac clients.
* Added the -FORCELOGFLUSH command line option. This option makes the game/server flush the log file every time it is written to.
* Added the -SETHOMEDIR= command line option. Normally, the game looks for the UnrealTournament.ini and User.ini files in \~/.utpg/System (on Linux), \~/Library/Application Support/Unreal Tournament/System (on Mac), or in UnrealTournament\System (on Windows). With this option, you can override the preferences path (e.g., ./ut-bin-x86 -sethomedir=\~/.loki/ut/System).
* Made pulsegun and minigun lockdown a configurable option that is disabled by default.
* UnrealI and UnrealShare decorations can no longer be destroyed if they have bStatic set.
* Merged Unreal 227's UnrealI and UnrealShare AI fixes.
