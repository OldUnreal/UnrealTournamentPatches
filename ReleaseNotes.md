## Unreal Tournament Version 469d Release Notes

Version 469d is completely network compatible with all previous public releases of UT (down to 432).
The UTPG and OldUnreal teams worked hard to maintain binary compatibility with older native mods.
Most of these mods will continue to work in version 469d. However, some mods may need some trivial updates.
If you are a native mod author, and you are having trouble updating your mod for version 469d, then please reach out to us at [the OldUnreal forums](https://www.oldunreal.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=37).
**Note:** This patch disables older versions of ACE.
Server admins should upgrade ACE to version 1.1e or later to check 469d clients.

### Patch Highlights

* This patch includes several performance fixes and improvements for clients and servers
* This patch adds support for Linux-aarch64/ARMv8 platforms. This means you can now host servers (or even play the game) on your Raspberry Pi 3/4! ([#1013](../../issues/1013), [Patreon Post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/83522201))
* Good news for movement-centric game types such as BunnyTrack: This patch fixes several long-standing movement and networking issues! (e.g., [#782](../../issues/782), [#805](../../issues/805), [#228](../../issues/228))
* We've dealt a real blow to the Editor goblin. 469d has tons of editor bug fixes, improvements, and new tools
* The 469d client should now automatically connect to the community master servers, regardless of how you installed it. If your server browser is still empty after installing the patch, then simply go to Options>Preferences>Network in the game menu and click the "Update/Fix Network Settings" button to restore your game's online functionality

### Patch Distribution

* Updated 3rd party dependencies:
- OpenAL-Soft version 1.22.2
- flac version 1.4.2
- SDL version 2.26.2
- mpg123 version 1.31.2

- One Tile: Fills a surface with a single tile, scaling the texture's width and height independently
- One Tile U: Fills a surface with a single tile, but only scales the width of the tile's texture to match the width of the surface. Will apply the same scale to the height of the texture
- One Tile V: Fills a surface with a single tile, but only scales the height of the tile's texture to match the height of the surface. Will apply the same scale to the width of the texture
```
(External Contribution by Buggie)

* Most UCC commandlets will now recognize the "--" command line delimiter. This delimiter allows you to separate commandlet-specific parameters from global UCC parameters
* D3D9Drv and OpenGLDrv now allow you to configure the color for selected surfaces in Unreal Editor ([#823](../../issues/823))
* Unreal Editor no longer adds a leading space to the command line parameters it passes to the game if said parameters start with a '?' character. This means you should now be able to set Editor.EditorEngine.GameCommandLine to, for example, "?Game=Botpack.CTFGame?Mutator=Botpack.InstaGibDM -log" ([#529](../../issues/529))
* The editor now gives you line information when warning about an unreferenced local variable during UnrealScript compilation ([#355](../../issues/355))

#### UnrealScript

* UnrealScript classes can now import other classes using a new "imports" directive. For example:
```
class MyClass extends Object imports(SomeOtherClass);
```
This new directive makes static functions, struct definitions, and enums declared in the imported class available in the importing class.
* The UnrealScript compiler now creates the Inc folder when exporting native class definitions
* UnrealScript structs can now be marked as native. This allows the compiler to export the definitions of these structs to C++ headers

* Made UTFadeTextAreas speed up their rendering animation if the mouse cursor hovers above them (External Contribution by Buggie)
* Implemented a "ReloadConfig <x>" console command that allows you to reload the configuration file of the specified object or class. If you do not specify any object or class, reloadconfig will reload the configuration of all known objects and classes ([#480](../../issues/480))
* Added a new advanced renderer properties window to the in-game menu
* Changed the default value of Botpack.CTFGame.bAutoRespawnFlags to false because the true setting broke BunnyTrack ([#279](../../issues/279))
* Made the in-game browser connect to OldUnreal's new UpdateServer. This server hosts a message of the day page and a masterserver list. Your client will automatically download this list and update its masterserver settings if you have bKeepMasterserver set to false in the [UBrowser.UBrowserMainClientWindow] of your game ini
* The in-game browser now supports clicking on https links
* If a function call gets absorbed, the UnrealScript VM will now return a default-initialized return value for the called function ([#1226](../../issues/1226))
* Added a "Fix/Update Network Settings" button to the in-game menu. This button will update your client's outdated masterserver settings and restore the server browser's functionality (External Contribution by Buggie)
* UWindowList now uses merge sort to sort lists. This speeds up sorting of large lists and fixes runaway loop crashes (External Contribution by Buggie)
* The player mesh in the player setup window should now rotate at a frame rate-independent speed (External Contribution by Buggie) ([#1393](../../issues/1393))

#### Audio and 3D Rendering

* Added support for various new audio formats (many of which were already supported by Galaxy and Cluster) in ALAudio ([#324](../../issues/324))
* The game should now be able to enforce high frame rate caps on Windows ([#176](../../issues/176))

#### Networking and Netcode

* The UZ compression and decompression code is now multithreaded. This should substantially increase (de)compression speed on clients and in UCC ([#935](../../issues/935), External Contribution by Buggie)
* The game will now try to reload packages when you're connecting to a server that runs a different version of a package that is already loaded. This should result in far fewer failed connections due to "Package Version Mismatches" ([#1251](../../issues/1251))
* The game will now display the total download progress when downloading packages from a game server ([#443](../../issues/443))

#### Localization

* Added Greek localization (External [Contribution](https://github.com/OldUnreal/unreal-localization/commit/92d9160399944fd79c736a4eac33efdd0cc3bbff) by LDinos)

#### Miscellaneous

* The macOS application bundle now contains a fully-featured version of UCC

* Added dynamic mylevel actor recompilation support. When enabled, the script compiler now allows you to change the class layout of actors that you've placed into your level. The following [Editor.EditorEngine] ini options control this feature's behavior:
```
- WarnForActorRecompilation (Bool - Default Value: True): Warns mappers when they are about to recompile the code for MyLevel actors. The warning explains why recompiling MyLevel actors is dangerous and informs them about the new actor recompilation ini options
- DynamicActorRecompilation (Bool - Default Value: False): Enables dynamic actor recompilation support. When the feature is disabled, Unreal Editor still allows you to recompile MyLevel actors, but the script compiler will not resize Actors after recompilation, nor update their properties to match the new class layout
```
* Unreal Editor now allows you to configure the width of the toolbar on the left-hand side of the screen. You can do this by setting the ToolbarWidth option in the [Options] section of UnrealEd.ini:
```
- ToolbarWidth (Integer - Default Value: 3): The number of buttons on every row of the toolbar
```

## Unreal Tournament Version 469b Release Notes

Version 469b is completely network compatible with all previous public releases of UT (down to 432).
The UTPG and OldUnreal teams worked hard to maintain binary compatibility with older native mods.
Most of these mods will continue to work in version 469b. However, some mods may need some trivial updates.
If you are a native mod author, and you are having trouble updating your mod for version 469b, then please reach out to us at [the OldUnreal forums](https://www.oldunreal.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=37).
**Note:** This patch disables older versions of ACE.
Server admins should upgrade ACE to version 1.1e or later to check 469b clients.

### Patch Distribution
* The Windows and Mac packages are now digitally signed. This should significantly reduce the amount of false-positive malware warnings.
* Updated the included OpenAL Soft binary for Windows to version 1.21.1
* Updated the included FMOD Engine binaries for all clients to version 2.1.08
* Updated the included libcurl binary for Windows to version 7.72.0_3 (this version will hopefully generate fewer false positive detections by malware scanners)

* Pawns that get destroyed while they have the Destroyed probe function disabled should now get unlinked from the Level Pawnlist.

### Enhancements

#### Unreal Editor

* Merged most of Unreal 227's Unreal Editor enhancements.
* UnrealEd's viewport window allows you to select any of your renderdevices now (not just SoftDrv and D3DDrv).
* UnrealEd's button bar and texture browser now have mouse wheel support.
* UnrealEd's 2D Shape Editor now properly calculates the vertex positions while dragging at zoom levels other than 100 pct.
* UnrealEd now supports mouse wheel scrolling in the 2D viewports.
* UnrealEd now has an "Add PlayerStart" item in the surface popup menu. This item only shows if your level does not have a PlayerStart yet.
* UnrealEd viewports can now render up to 200 frames per second. This framerate was previously capped at 30.
* UnrealEd's vertex editor now properly accumulates small vertex adjustments. Previously, small adjustments could get discarded due to grid snapping.
* Added texture format conversion support to the texture browser.
* Added an option to remove the compressed mips from a texture in the texture browser.
* All UnrealEd viewports now support renderdevice switching.
* Added texture import support for various new image formats.
* The ucc make commandlet now works on Linux and Mac.
* The ucc compress commandlet can now skip compression if an up-to-date .uz file already exists. To use this new feature, add the "update" command line parameter to your ucc compress invocation.
* S3TC/DXT1 texture compression should now be available in the ucc tools for Linux and Mac (though obviously not in UnrealEd).

#### High-resolution Support

* UnrealEd, Setup, and the game client are now high-DPI aware on Windows. This eliminates the bluriness a lot of people with big monitors were seeing. It also improves input precision in the game and the editor.
* Added automatic scaling of the game menu. The scaling factor and behavior can be controlled using the new settings in the menu.
* Added crosshair scaling to the standard HUD. You can configure the crosshair scaling settings in the menu. NOTE: A lot of mods will likely ignore the crosshair scaling. Mod authors should update their mods so they call the regular ChallengeHUD.DrawCrosshair function.
* Added in-game font scaling. When enabled, fonts scale automatically with your desktop DPI. Scaling can be turned on and off in the in-game menu.
* UWindow now supports higher resolution textures for LookAndFeels. This enables LookAndFeels to scale better for people playing at higher resolutions and higher GUI scales. The UMenu LookAndFeels have been (partially) updated to use this new feature.

#### Input and Windowing

* Fixed mouse acceleration issues for players using DirectInput on Windows 10.
* Added raw mouse input support. This feature can be enabled by setting the UseRawHIDInput to true in the WinDrv.WindowsClient section of the game ini.
* Added enhanced pointer precision control. By default, the game enables enhanced pointer precision while in the menu and restores the old precision settings when in game. However, you can now set the NoEnhancedPointerPrecision option in the WinDrv.WindowsClient section to true if you do not want the game to change the system pointer precision settings at all.
* Added new menu options to control the mouse input and smoothing behavior.
* Improved support for mouse side buttons.
* Added mouse wheel scrolling support to the in-game windowing system.
* Added clipboard paste support to the quick console.
* The Linux and Mac clients now have clipboard support.

#### UnrealScript

* Console commands that are over 1024 bytes in length, or that return over 1024 bytes of data should now be safe to use.
* Added a new primitive type called "pointer". Pointer variables automatically adjust to the word width on the target platform. Native mod authors should use pointer variables to mirror a pointer type in C++.
* Added new Canvas functions to create arbitrarily-sized fonts on the fly. Please do not use these functions directly as they will cause your mod to be incompatible with earlier versions of UT. Instead, use the BotPack.FontInfo class to retrieve fonts that are appropriate for the client's screen size.
* Added the "TEXTURE MERGECOMPRESSED NAME=MergeWith FILE=HiResFile.PNG GROUP= " exec command. This command allows you to import and compress hi-res textures and merge them into an existing texture's compressed mipmaps.
* Added HandlePauseRequest to the mutator system, allows modders to modify the behaviour of players' pause button in servers.

#### Security

* Fixed several arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.
* The Windows version of the game now has several security enhancements including (but not limited to) Data Execution Prevention (can be disabled with the -nodep command line parameter), SafeSEH, and ASLR support.

#### Anti-Cheat

* Revamped the UT v468 MD5 code. Older clients can connect to v469a servers now even if they don't support the MD5 extension. The server now also marks which files it wants MD5 checks for.
* MD5 checking is now disabled by default. To enable, set MD5Enable to True under [Engine.GameEngine] in the server's ini file.
* Added an auto-updater for the Packages.md5 list. The auto-updater will check for list updates once an hour if you have MD5Enable and MD5AutoUpdate both set to true under [Engine.GameEngine].

#### Networking and Netcode

* Restored demo compatibility with UT v436.
* Added workarounds for bugs that could cause player animations to break in demos or online play after installing high-resolution S3TC textures.
* Made improvements to the networking code to eliminate the infamous texture skating problem (in nearly all cases).
* The game no longer disables Download Managers if they encounter a non-critical error while attempting to download a file from the server. Previously, the game would stop attempting to download from redirect servers after encountering an HTTP error (such as HTTP 404).
* The game now shows the number of remaining packages while downloading from a server.
* Clients are far less likely to encounter package mismatch errors when connecting to servers, now a UT client can have multiple packages with the same name and the loader will select the right one (if present).
* Added bandwidth control for file downloads from the gameserver. The bandwidth control option overrides the MaxClientRate. It can be controlled in the server.ini file as follows:
```
[IpDrv.TcpNetDriver]
MaxFileDownloadRate=0   Maximum download speed in bytes per second

; Possible values for MaxFileDownloadRate:
; -1                    Send files at the maximum speed possible
;  0                    Limit the file download speed to MaxClientRate bytes per second. This is what UT did by default in versions 468 and below
;  any positive number  Allow download speeds of up to this amount of bytes per second.
```

#### Audio and 3D Rendering

* Screenshots now get stored in the "System/Screenshots" folder. UT will automatically create this folder if it does not already exist. We also removed the limit on the number of screenshots you can have in this folder and we now save screenshots in PNG format rather than BMP.
* Decals are now visible in fog zones.
* Integrated Cluster, a new FMOD-based audio driver with superior sound quality and hyper-realistic sound effects (Thanks han!).
* Integrated enhanced versions of Chris Dohnal's UTGLR OpenGLDrv and D3D9Drv. 
* Integrated OldUnreal's latest XOpenGLDrv. 
* Galaxy Audio is now considered deprecated. On Windows Vista and later, the game launcher will do an automatic one-time upgrade your audio subsystem to the latest version of the OldUnreal Cluster driver.
* Revamped the underlying audio code for sounds played using TournamentPlayer.ClientPlaySound. The revamped code should make playback volumes more consistent and should eliminate audio glitches such as crackling and screeching.

#### Localization

* New language: German (requires testing)
* Italian and French have been fully updated (both require testing)
* Minor changes to Spanish

#### Miscellaneous

* UnrealEd and the game client are now large address aware on Windows. This means it is far less likely that you'll run out of virtual memory.
* Removed some outdated items from the in-game menu (e.g., ngWorldStats, mplayer, heat, won, ...)
* Rewrote some of the core timing routines so the game runs more smoothly (and with less glitching) on multicore CPUs and in long-running games.
* The Linux and Mac clients finally support unicode! The most visible consequence is that player names with non-ascii characters in them will now display correctly when playing on Linux servers (provided that you use font textures with the proper unicode glyphs).
* The game now uses UTF-8 as the prefered file encoding (unless a UTF-16LE BOM is found at the start of the file).
* Added selectedcursor support to the Linux and Mac clients.
* Added the -FORCELOGFLUSH command line option. This option makes the game/server flush the log file every time it is written to.
* Added the -SETHOMEDIR= command line option. Normally, the game looks for the UnrealTournament.ini and User.ini files in \~/.utpg/System (on Linux), \~/Library/Application Support/Unreal Tournament/System (on Mac), or in UnrealTournament\System (on Windows). With this option, you can override the preferences path (e.g., ./ut-bin-x86 -sethomedir=\~/.loki/ut/System).
* Made pulsegun and minigun lockdown a configurable option that is disabled by default.
* UnrealI and UnrealShare decorations can no longer be destroyed if they have bStatic set.
* Merged Unreal 227's UnrealI and UnrealShare AI fixes.
